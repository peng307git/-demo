                    <p>The trust interest of Mind Bank is one issuing way of new currency as one part of Mind Asset system distribution. It accomplish a fairer distribution and more potential value space from the view of issuing and value. Users could gain the opposite interest in different trust time limit by locking their private asset into time chain. The distribution mechanism is a reward of Mind Bank for users based on the trust for M.A value trend. </p>
                    <p>The system trust interest of Mind Bank is sent by preposition method and different from the fixed time deposit of real bank. That is to say, the system interest will deposit to the private account automatically once users lock MG into lock time. Users could withdraw and use the interest after locking the trust block.</p>

                    <h3> 1. System Trust Interest Issuing Regulation：</h3>
                    <div class="clearfix">
                        <p>1.1 The design of System Trust Interest rate is from the most regular and stable figure combination——142857. Mind Asset set up this mysterious discover as the rate standard of system trust interest. It not only represents the admiration for human, but also represent that Mind Bank will achieve a fairer and stable system zoology as a decentralization system.</p>

                        <p>1.2 The amount of the Mind Bank Trust Interest is about 24 hundred million MG and the trust time limit is from 32 to 1024-day. The longer the elected trust time is, the corresponding rate of interest will be higher. In other words, the profit space will be bigger on the same deposit amount. We could do a calculation according to the rate design, if you store 10 thousand MG in Lock Time and choose the highest interest rate (1024-day whose daily rate is 9.99999%), you will win the interest about 10239.9898. </p>

                        <p>That’s to say, if you deposit your asset in Lock Time and choose the longest trust time in the first deposit cycle. Then you could obtain the double interest profit. It is also the only chance to obtain double award in the Mind Bank Trust Interest System Distribution Mechanism</p>

                        <p>1.3 The total interests of system trust is declining circularly. The interest rate per hundred days in different trust period will declined by 10% from current interest rate when reward total improved ten percent. While, the reward of next period will be 10% of now. Take the first period as an example, when 10% of total reward which is 240 million MG have been provided, the reward of next period declined to 216 million. The highest interest rate per hundred days will fall by 10% to 8.99991%.And so on, we can calculate the reward of every period and the decreasing amplitude.</p>

                    <div class="clearfix">
                        <p>1.4 Due to the rules of descending of the rate and trust reward of every period are irreversible, as time goes by and growing in number of modules, the total deliver of system trust interest rate will become increasingly lower, the rate will decline with it till to be ignore finally. From the diagram representing the amount of system trust interests and declining of the rate of interests, we can see, if we choose the longest trust period which is 1024 days as the first storage period, and the interest rate per hundred is 9.99999%,the rate will be 100% at this period. In another word, when we unlock the account, our finance will be twice as before. When the interests was delivered after third period, the residue amount of fourth period is already declined about one third, and the interest rate is declined about one third, too. Therefore, the earlier we catch the chance to store, the more chance we will have to get the one third of total system interests. And the earlier we stored, the space of benefit will be bigger.  </p>
